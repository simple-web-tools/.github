# simple web tools

This is an organization for projects relating to simple tools that help us work with html along with simple but complete html/css/js minimal sites which accomplish a single task, to be integrated into other sites.

The idea is that all the web code (which may be generated by scripts) in this repository should follow the principles proposed by [w3c](https://www.w3.org/)
